### Summary : Currently, I'm working on 3D experimental game.
> Those are all about human nature and our mental problems. 

------------------------------------------------

### 2020.03.07 : Inspired by my favorite songs.
> Sometimes, I really think music is the most powerful thing that influences me.
> When I think of something new or when I have to get some inspirations, I always come up with my
> favorite songs first. Those have quiet same vibe, which is neutral and sometimes, vague.

### 2020.03.08 : waking up
> I can't explain but I can feel mine wants to be woken as soon as possible. But we should wait sometimes.
> Maybe we can see the open world nearby. Enough is enough!
